        <h2> Biography </h2>
        <p> Great personalities are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are remembered for
            millennials to come. One such great personality that we will always be proud of is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. His
            full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October
            1931 and died on July 27, 2015, Shillong. He was an Indian Scientist and also a politician leader, who later
            became the 11th President of India. He played an important role in the development of India’s missile and
            nuclear weapons program. Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th
            July 2002 to 25th July 2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin of
            votes. National Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi Party
            and National Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had done uncountable works
            for the welfare of the people and through the entire country.


            He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if that was tough or
            sensitive or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The
            “office of profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual
            who has a professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a
            pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the royal
            family to have zero influence on the administrative conditions.


            He had also become one of the most talked-about presidents Rule in 2005 for imposing the Presidents’ rule in
            Bihar. Kalam expressed his wish to take up the position one more time but then later changed his mind.


            After taking farewell from the office, he shifted and commenced his career as a visiting professor at the
            Indian Institute of Management in Shillong. He served as an Aerospace Engineering professor at Anna
            University, Tamil Nadu. He also lit up educational institutions like the Indian Institute of Indore, Indian
            Institute of Bangalore with his presence and knowledge. Sir Kalam served as chancellor Indian Institute of
            Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
