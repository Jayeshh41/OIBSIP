The repository contains the Web development projects I have designed during my Internship period at Oasis Infobyte.
These projects helped me to leverage my Web Design skills and also helped me to learn and explore different things i wasn't known to!
The project list includes: 
1) A Basic Calculator
2) A Tribute Page
3) A Basic To-Do App
4) A Login Authentication Page
